# üìä General Ledger Financial Analysis

## üìå Project Overview  
This project demonstrates how to transform a General Ledger dataset (2,000 Records) into meaningful financial reports and KPIs using only Excel and Power Query.  

The dataset includes Revenue, COGS, and Expense accounts, along with Department, Cost Center, and Multi-Currency codes.  
The goal was to replicate real-world financial reporting by building:  

- Trial Balance  
- Profit & Loss Statement (P&L)  
- Department & Cost Analysis  
- Multi-Currency Reporting  
- KPI Dashboard

## üìä Business Questions Answered  

1. **Trial Balance ‚Äì Are Debits and Credits balanced?**  
   - Used =SUM(Debit) ‚Äì SUM(Credit) check, reviwed using pivotTable drill-down. 
   - Found imbalance: -763,041.46 (base currency) and -816,590.15 USD (after conversion).
   - ``=SUM(Debit) - SUM(Credit)``

2. **P&L Statement ‚Äì What is Net Profit by month/year?**  
   - Built with SUMIFS for Revenue, COGS, and Expenses.  
   - Net Profit = Revenue ‚Äì Expenses.
   - Gross Profit = Total Revenue - COGS
   - NetProfitUSD ```=(SUMIFS(H:H,B:B,"Online Sales")+SUMIFS(H:H,B:B,"Sales Revenue"))
-(SUMIFS(H:H,B:B,"COGS")+SUMIFS(H:H,B:B,"Travel Expense")+SUMIFS(H:H,B:B,"Payroll Expense"))```

3. **Department Analysis ‚Äì Which department incurs the highest expenses?**  
   - PivotTable grouped by Department.  
   - Travel expense was consistently the largest.   

4. **Multi-Currency ‚Äì How do exchange rate fluctuations affect reporting?**  
   - Created an Exchange Rate table in Excel.  
   - Added NetAmountUSD column via Power Query merge.
   - Used INDEX MATCH to verify ``=INDEX(ExchangeRate[Rate2USD], MATCH(GL!L:L,ExchangeRate[Currency], 0))``  
   - Compared results with and without conversion.  

5. **Revenue/Expense Trend ‚Äì How has Sales Revenue grown across months/years?**  
   - PivotChart with Month on axis + Year as slicer.
   - Visualized with a lines chart
   ![](Revenue.png) REVENUE
   ![](Expense.png) EXPENSE

7. **Transaction Analysis ‚Äì Which accounts have the highest number of postings?** 
   - Used COUNTIFS by AccountName.  
   - Sales Revenue had the most activity.
   - Drill-down of count of posting visualized.
